Go to bitbuild.com and clone the as much of the site as you can in an hour.

You are free to use/modify the provided HTML template OR create your own.

You are not expected to complete the entire page within an hour. Good execution of one or two sections is better than poor execution of 4 or 5 sections.

The purpose is to evaluate your CSS ability and basic Javascript ability.

Do not simply copy the background image from the "We Write Code" section of the hero section of the site. Try to use a photo from unsplash and execute the color effect with your own CSS.

Things I would like to see (in no particular order):

-The "We Write code" section of the page.

-The "Request Info" button pop up.

-"Clients and parnters Include" section.

-"We'll be your coding stunt double" section.

-Footer work

Do not worry if you don't finish within an hour. We will discuss how you did during the next interview.
